marquee-twitter-feed
====================

A marquee style twitter feed, because people still really seem to dig that horizontal boogaloo

It uses:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [Silky Smooth Marquee](http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/) from Remy Sharp
* [chirp.js](http://lab.rog.ie/chirp/) by Rogie (jQuery not required for this)

It's here because I'm tired of dredging it out of old sites I've done for clients to re-use.
